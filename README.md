# Metr: IoT Shared Parking

### General Overview
We're building an application that gives people the ability to temporarily rent out their own parking spaces, similar to AirBnb. 

### Hardware
Each parking space is tracked using a custom sensor that is connected to the internet. This way, users can seamlessly pay for their parking through an app connected to the internet. Likewise, the user now has easy access to a list of available parking spots in the area. 

### [Mobile Frontend](https://github.com/kierajmumick/City-Meter)
A user can use an iOS application to find available parking spaces on Metr. Once a user has parked in an available space, he can easily pay for his parking through the app.

### Web Frontend
A user can register and administrate his own parking spaces using the Metr web application. Here he can adjust hourly parking rates, hours of availability, get notifications of delinquent parkers, and the like.
